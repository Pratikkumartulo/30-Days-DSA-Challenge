Postorder traversal is defined as a type of tree traversal which follows the Left-Right-Root policy such that for each node:

The left subtree is traversed first
Then the right subtree is traversed
Finally, the root node of the subtree is traversed


The idea is to use any of the tree traversals to traverse the tree and while traversing check if the current node matches with the given node. Print YES if any node matches with the given node and stop traversing further and if the tree is completely traversed and none of the node matches with the given node then print NO.
