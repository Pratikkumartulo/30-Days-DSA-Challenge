Without PrefixSum:
    here without prefix Sum array we have to traverse the array from the start point too the end point which basically takes more time
    and also very small, So we have implemented the Prefix Sum array Idea.

With PrefixSum array :
            In prefixSum array we take the sum of each elements with all the elements previous of it and then build a prefix array.

            If we want to get the result of sum of array from index i to j, then we can use the formula, 
                Sum = arrayName[j]-arrayName[i-1]
