A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains three fields:
    Data Field: Contains the value or data stored in the node.
    Next Pointer: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.
    Previous Pointer: A pointer/reference to the previous node in the list.

Node Class: This class defines the structure of a node in a doubly linked list. Each node contains three attributes:
    val: The value stored in the node.
    next: A pointer to the next node in the list.
    prev: A pointer to the previous node in the list.

    
And all the operations are same as the singly linked list, just we have to update the "prev" field of each Node
