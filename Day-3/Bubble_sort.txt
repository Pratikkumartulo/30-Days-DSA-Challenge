Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.


In Bubble Sort algorithm, 
 ~traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
 ~In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
 ~This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

The "changed" variable acts as a flag to monitor whether any elements in the array were swapped during an iteration of the inner loop or not. Its main purpose is to detect if the array is already sorted.
If found sorted it help the algorithm to terminate early, which can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary iterations further.
