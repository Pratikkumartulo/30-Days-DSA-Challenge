Heap data structure is mainly used to represent a priority queue. In Python, it is available using the “heapq” module. The property of this data structure in Python is that each time the smallest heap element is popped(min-heap). Whenever elements are pushed or popped, heap structure is maintained. The heap[0] element also returns the smallest element each time.

heappush(heap, ele): This function is used to insert the element mentioned in its arguments into a heap. The order is adjusted, so that heap structure is maintained.
heappop(heap): This function is used to remove and return the smallest element from the heap. The order is adjusted, so that heap structure is maintained.
heappushpop(heap, ele):- This function combines the functioning of both push and pop operations in one statement, increasing efficiency. Heap order is maintained after this operation.
