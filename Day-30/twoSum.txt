The two_sum function solves the problem of finding two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specified target. It uses a two-pointer approach:

    Initialization: Set left pointer to the start and right pointer to the end of the array.
    Loop:   Continue while left is less than right.
            Calculate the sum of the elements at left and right.
            If the sum equals the target, return the 1-based indices of left and right.
            If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer right to increase the sum.
            If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer left to decrease the sum.
    Return: If no such pair is found, return an empty list.
