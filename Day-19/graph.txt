In this code, we have studied about how to add edge in a Graph Structure.

add_Edge function:
    First in the add_Edge function we check if the given Nodes are avaialable in the graph or not.
    If present it proceed to further procesure and if not present, It stops there only
    After finding the Nodes, It update the adjency Matrix 

For weighted Graph:
    for weighted graph, we also have to pass another argument that is the weight of the edge, in the add_Edge function.
    And in the adjency matrix we have to save the weight in the correct position

For directed Graph:
        In directed graph, we only update the edge to "1" in the adjency matrix for the node where the edge is outgoing.
