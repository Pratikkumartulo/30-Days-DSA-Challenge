Trie Data Structure
        Definition:
            A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. It is particularly efficient for searching prefixes and performing auto-completion.

        Structure:
            Nodes: Represent characters.
            Root Node: Represents an empty string and serves as the starting point.
            Edges: Connect nodes and correspond to characters in the strings.
            End of Word Marker: Each node has a boolean flag indicating if it is the end of a valid word.
