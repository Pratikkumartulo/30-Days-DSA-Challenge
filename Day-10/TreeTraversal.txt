Inorder traversal is defined as a type of tree traversal technique which follows the Left-Root-Right pattern, such that:

The left subtree is traversed first
Then the root node for that subtree is traversed
Finally, the right subtree is traversed



Preorder traversal is defined as a type of tree traversal that follows the Root-Left-Right policy where:

The root node of the subtree is visited first.
Then the left subtree  is traversed.
At last, the right subtree is traversed.
